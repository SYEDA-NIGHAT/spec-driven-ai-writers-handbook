# Chapter 1 — Understanding Spec-Driven Writing

Spec-driven writing means you write using **clear, structured specifications** that guide AI and keep control in your hands.

## Why Spec-Driven?
- Ensures consistent book structure  
- Prevents AI from hallucinating  
- Keeps chapters aligned  
- Makes editing easier  

## Core Components
1. **Goal** — What the chapter must achieve  
2. **Constraints** — What NOT to include  
3. **Sections** — The logical flow  
4. **Examples** — For clarity  
5. **Deliverables** — What the AI should output  

You will use this technique for every chapter in the book.
